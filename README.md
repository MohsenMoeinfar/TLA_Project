# Project Template

## Phase 0: DFA Implementation

- Implement a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) class
- Implement union, star, and concat operations for FAs

## Phase 1: Picture Array to DFA Conversion

- Implement a converter that transforms a picture array (picArr) into a DFA
- Use the algorithm described in the paper for the conversion process

## Phase 2: Picture Recognition

- Implement picture recognition functionality
- Given a DFA machine and a picture, determine if the picture is equal to the original picture of the DFA

## Phase 3: Picture Classification

- Implement picture classification functionality
- For each picture, determine which DFA machine it is closest to

## Phase 4: DFA to Picture Array Conversion

- Implement a converter that recovers the original picture from a DFA machine
- Generate a picture array (picArr) from the given DFA

**Note:** You are allowed to modify the DFA class and project structure as needed. The primary goals are to ensure that the tests pass and the visualization is successful."# TLA_Project"
